Thanks for visiting my blog. In my free time I enjoy writing poetry with the Poetry Sisters, reading science fiction, making new cocktails, and singing with the choir at [Trinity on the Hill Episcopal Church](http://latoth.org/).

I'm a scientist at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://lanl.gov) in Los Alamos, New Mexico. I have a PhD in [physics](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a BS in physics and minor in creative writing from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I grew up in seven states and three countries with my Air Force family, and I attended the [North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics](http://ncssm.edu) in Durham, North Carolina.
