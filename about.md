I'm a graduate student in the [physics department](http://physics.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I do research on quantum information with [a group of awesome people](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/). We study strange quantum effects such as entanglement, and try to figure out how to build quantum computers and communication systems. We also work with lasers, sometimes wear bowties, and spend a lot of time in the dark.

I get excited about good writing, especially good science writing. I like to think about why some explanations of difficult subjects succeed&mdash;and why so many others fail. What great things could happen if we all understood each other?

I grew up as an Air Force brat, and I lived in Japan, New Mexico, Alabama, Germany, Virginia, Rhode Island, Washington D.C., Mississippi, and North Carolina before moving to my current home in Illinois. These are the two cats that live with me, Astrid and Emmy:
