I'm a physicist in beautiful Los Alamos, New Mexico.

Work: Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory

School: PhD, [physics](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/) - University of Illinois; BS physics/creative writing - University of North Carolina

In the rest of my life, I enjoy Americana music, poetry, science fiction, exploring New Mexico, and singing with the choir at [Trinity on the Hill Episcopal Church](http://latoth.org/).

I grew up in an Air Force family and lived in Japan, New Mexico, Alabama, Germany, Virginia, Rhode Island, Washington DC, Mississippi, and North Carolina before graduating from high school.
