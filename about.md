I'm a graduate student in the [physics department](http://physics.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I do research on quantum information with [a group of awesome people](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/). I also help answer science questions on the physics department's [Ask the Van](http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/) Q&A website.

I get excited about good writing, especially good science writing. I like to think about why some explanations of difficult subjects succeed&mdash;and why so many others fail. What great things could happen if we all understood each other?

These are the two cats that live with me, Astrid and Emmy:
