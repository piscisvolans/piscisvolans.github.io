I'm a scientist/cat lady in beautiful Los Alamos, New Mexico, where I work as a postdoc at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

I went to graduate school in the [physics department](http://physics.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I did research in quantum optics with [a great group of people](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/).

In the rest of my life, I like Americana music, cooking, poetry, science fiction, planning for the apocalypse, and smashing the patriarchy.

I grew up in an Air Force family and lived in Japan, New Mexico, Alabama, Germany, Virginia, Rhode Island, Washington DC, Mississippi, and North Carolina before graduating from high school.

As a grad student I helped answer science questions on the Physics Illinois [Ask the Van](http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/) Q&A website.
