**Work**: Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory (opinions are my own)

**School**: PhD, [physics](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/) - University of Illinois; BS physics/creative writing - University of North Carolina

In the rest of my life, I enjoy writing poetry with the Poetry Sisters, playing Americana music, reading science fiction, exploring New Mexico, and singing with the choir at [Trinity on the Hill Episcopal Church](http://latoth.org/).

I grew up in an Air Force family and lived in Japan, New Mexico, Alabama, Germany, Virginia, Rhode Island, Washington DC, Mississippi, and North Carolina before graduating from high school. These days I call New Mexico home.

At the University of Illinois I used to answer science questions on the Physics Illinois [Ask the Van](http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/) Q&A website.
