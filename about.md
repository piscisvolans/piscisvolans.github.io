I'm a graduate student in the [physics department](http://physics.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I work in [a group of awesome people](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/) doing research on quantum information and quantum optics. We study strange quantum effects such as entanglement, and try to figure out how to build quantum computers and communication systems. We also work with lasers, sometimes wear bowties, and spend a lot of time in the dark.

I get excited about good writing, especially good science writing. I like to think about why some explanations of difficult subjects succeed&mdash;and why so many others fail. Have you ever wondered if scientists, too, find the writing in peer-reviewed journals difficult to follow? I'll admit it&mdash;I do. It's [not just](http://engineering.missouri.edu/civil/files/science-of-writing.pdf) the complexity of the topics. What great things could happen if we all understood each other?
