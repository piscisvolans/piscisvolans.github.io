I'm a scientist in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where I work as a postdoc at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

I went to [graduate school](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/) at the University of Illinois, and college at the University of North Carolina.

In the rest of my life, I like Americana music, cooking, poetry, science fiction, and planning for the apocalypse.

I grew up in an Air Force family and lived in Japan, New Mexico, Alabama, Germany, Virginia, Rhode Island, Washington DC, Mississippi, and North Carolina before graduating from high school.

I have some projects on GitHub as [piscisvolans](https://github.com/piscisvolans).

As a grad student I helped answer science questions on the Physics Illinois [Ask the Van](http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/) Q&A website.
