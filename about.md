I'm a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. I have a PhD in [physics](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a BS in physics and minor in creative writing from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I attended the [North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics](http://ncssm.edu) after moving between six other states and three countries with my Air Force family.

I enjoy writing poetry with the Poetry Sisters, playing Americana music, reading science fiction, exploring New Mexico, and singing with the choir at [Trinity on the Hill Episcopal Church](http://latoth.org/).
