I'm a graduate student in the [physics department](http://physics.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I do research on quantum optics with [a group of awesome people](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/).

After grad school (Ph.D. expected 2017) I want to solve technology and policy problems in space exploration and help put humans on Mars.

Outside of work, I enjoy Americana music, hiking and camping, science fiction, and trying to outsmart my cats. I also [write poetry]({{ site.baseurl }}/poetry/).

As a kid I was an Air Force brat, and we lived in Japan, New Mexico, Alabama, Germany, Virginia, Rhode Island, Washington DC, Mississippi, and North Carolina.
