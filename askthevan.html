<p><a href="http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/">Ask the Van</a> is the public Q&A service of the <a href="http://physics.illinois.edu">Department of Physics</a> at the University of Illinois (where I went to grad school). Anyone can submit a question, and physics professors and student volunteers answer as many as possible.

<h2>Questions I answered</h2>
