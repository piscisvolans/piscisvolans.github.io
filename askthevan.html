<a href="http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/">Ask the Van</a> is the public Q&A service of the <a href="http://physics.illinois.edu">Department of Physics</a> at the University of Illinois. Anyone can submit a question, and physics professors and student volunteers answer as many as possible. (It's called Ask the Van because of the <a href="http://van.physics.illinois.edu/index.php">Physics Van</a>, a traveling science demo program also run by the physics department.)
