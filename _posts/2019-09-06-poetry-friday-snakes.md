Our poetry challenge this month, from Laura Purdie Salas, was to write a poem comparing something with a snake, in 8 lines or less. Because Poetry Friday is hosted this month by [Poetry for Children](http://poetryforchildren.blogspot.com/) I was inspired to try writing something fun and silly that I would have liked when I was a kid.

<h2>Snakes</h2>
<pre class="poem">
snakes in a story
snakes in a jar
snakes in a quarry
snakes in the stars
snakes under rocks
snakes in schemes
snakes in your socks
snakes in dreams
