Our poetry challenge this month, from Laura Purdie Salas, was to write a poem comparing something with a snake in 8 lines or less. Because Poetry Friday is hosted this month by [Poetry for Children](http://poetryforchildren.blogspot.com/), I was inspired to try writing something fun that I would have liked when I was a kid (not my usual genre).

Also, here's a snake.

<pre class="poem">
snakes in your socks
snakes in your dreams
snakes under rocks
snakes in schemes
snakes in a jar
snakes in the quarry
snakes in the stars
snakes in allegory
