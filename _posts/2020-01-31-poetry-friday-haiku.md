New year, new Poetry Friday procrastination! I'm late, but I'm here. This month we're writing haiku on the theme of foresight, or the new year.

<br>
<h2>Haiku</h2>
<pre class="poem">
My amaryllis
bulb grew a new shoot this week.
Someone watered it.
</pre>
<br><br>

I had to travel for work so I was out of the office for about a week. I came back today to find that the soil around my amaryllis bulb is newly damp and it's growing happily. Thanks, anonymous plant-loving coworker! The lesson of today's poem is that sometimes you make zero effort and everything is still okay.

Please visit my poetry sisters and read their January haiku!
