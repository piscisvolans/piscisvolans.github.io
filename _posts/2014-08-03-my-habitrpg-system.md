One of the most important parts of my experimental setup, a UV laser, had to be repaired this summer. The repair took about six weeks (I had to send the laser back to the manufacturer, which my mom called "going to laser camp"), and during that time my normal work routine disappeared. At first it was kind of awesome, since my schedule got a lot more flexible and I was planning to take some vacation time anyway.

But eventually, I got bored. I had to do *something* at the lab, and coming up with useful stuff to do&mdash;and motivating myself to do it&mdash;got painful. My laser is back now, but in the last few weeks that it was gone I started playing around with a website called [HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com/), which actually helped so much that I felt a little bit ridiculous.

In HabitRPG, you're represented by a little role-playing game avatar who gains (or loses) points when you do (or don't do) what you're supposed to in real life. This is so motivating that you will be ashamed. Was this really all your life needed? A pixelated hero who can buy a sword and a pet tiger cub if you make it to work on time? Apparently so.

It's almost entirely up to the player to decide how the game works, because you enter your own tasks and give yourself points for accomplishing them. It's also up to the player to keep the game balanced and reasonably challenging, which can be tricky when you can give yourself credit for waking up in the morning or flushing the toilet, or lose a bunch of health from tasks that you're never going to do every day ("Write Awesome Blog Post"). There's a good [wiki](http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/HabitRPG_Wiki) with advice about how to make it work for you.
