One of the most important parts of my experimental setup, a UV laser, had to be repaired this summer. The repair took about six weeks (I had to send the laser back to the manufacturer, which my mom called "going to laser camp"), and during that time my normal work routine disappeared. At first it was kind of awesome, since my schedule got a lot more flexible and I was planning to take some vacation time anyway.

But eventually, I got bored. I had to do *something* at the lab, and coming up with useful stuff to do&mdash;and motivating myself to do it&mdash;got painful. My laser is back now, but in the last few weeks that it was gone I started playing around with a website called [HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com/), which actually helped so much that I felt a little bit ridiculous.

In HabitRPG, you're represented by a little role-playing game avatar who gains (or loses) points when you do (or don't do) what you're supposed to in real life. This is so motivating that you will be ashamed. Was this really all your life needed? A pixelated hero who can buy a sword and a pet tiger cub if you make it to work on time? 

Yes. And that's okay.

It's almost entirely up to the player to decide how the game works, because you enter your own tasks and give yourself points for accomplishing them. It's also up to the player to keep the game balanced and reasonably challenging, which can be tricky when you can give yourself credit for waking up in the morning or flushing the toilet, or lose a bunch of health from tasks that you're never going to do every day ("Write Awesome Blog Post").

This is how I try to make HabitRPG useful and fun. There's also lot of good information about how to use the game on the [HabitRPG wiki](http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/HabitRPG_Wiki).

Categories
--------------

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}public/img/tags.gif" title="My HabitRPG tags">

I use the tags feature to sort my tasks into categories. I have a bunch of categories because I like organizing things, but the main ones are "lab" and "personal." I use these tags to filter lab-related stuff when I'm at home and personal stuff when I'm at the lab. There's also a special "being awesome" tag, which corresponds to a particular daily task that I'll explain below.

Daily tasks
---------------

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}public/img/dailies.gif" title="My HabitRPG Dailies">

My daily tasks meet two criteria:

1. It's actually important for me to do them on a daily basis (or on the specific day they are assigned to; for example, I have to put the recycling out on Wednesdays).

2. I need some motivation&mdash;the amount varies from task to task&mdash;to get them done. That's why I include "Floss," but not "Brush my teeth," and "Get to the lab by 9:30 AM" instead of "Go to the lab."

These two rules keep Dailies useful and help avoid making the game too easy.

A lot of the Dailies in this screenshot are greyed out, because it's Sunday and I don't have to do them. But two of them are always greyed out (accomplished by unselecting every day of the week) for different reasons. "Take medicine on time" is just a reminder&mdash;it satisfies rule 1 but not rule 2, so I don't check it off for points. "Get to the lab by 9:30 AM" is a bonus task that I get to check if I make it to work early. Eventually I plan to make it the main task and delete "Get to the lab by 10 AM," but I need to get used to that routine first.

"Be awesome" is a special task which can be checked off by doing any of the Habits I tag with "being awesome," discussed below.

Habits
--------------

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}public/img/habits-lab.gif" title="My HabitRPG lab habits">

Habits are a different type of task which don't need to be checked off every day, but can be used to give yourself points for doing something beneficial (or to do damage for bad habits).

At first I went a little crazy adding habits, and eventually felt like I had way too many. I narrowed them down using criteria similar to the guidelines for Dailies. Habits must either:

a) Be something I want to stop doing ("No caffeine after 3PM"), or

b) Be something I want to encourage that needs a little extra motivation ("Bring lunch").

Finally, I have a special class of Habits with the "being awesome" tag. These are things like "read a book," "yoga practice" and "play guitar." I can check off the "Be awesome" Daily by doing any of them. (I just called it "being awesome" for fun... and because I didn't want to call it something lame like "personal development.")

The other category of tasks, To-Dos, are pretty straightforward, so I guess that's about it. I hope it was useful for anyone starting out with HabitRPG. 

(Now to give myself credit for writing this!)
