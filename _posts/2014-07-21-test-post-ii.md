<p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. No. We're on the top. What are their names? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. You don't know how to do any of those.</p>
<h2>A Taste of Freedom</h2>
<p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that's it. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!  I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</p>

<h5>Lethal Inspection</h5>
<p>No! Don't jump! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! One hundred dollars. I never loved you.</p>
