It's time for poetry Friday again!

This month's challenge, from Liz Garton Scanlon, is to write a [triolet](https://poets.org/text/triolet-poetic-form), a French form with seven lines and only two rhymes. The first two lines are repeated, giving a rhyme scheme ABaAabAB. "Heat" is our theme.

I'm going backpacking for a night this weekend, so I have campfires on the brain.

<h2>Campfire</h2>
<pre class="poem">
How slow the hours of this light.
How many lifetimes in that dark
behind us. Their flames how bright,
how slow. The hours of this light
pass unrecognized, unmarked.
How slow the hours of this light,
how many. Lifetimes in that dark.

Please visit my poetry sisters and read their triolets!
