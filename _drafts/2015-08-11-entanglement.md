Developing intuitive understanding has always been the most satisfying experience for me in studying physics. Without intuition, I struggle to solve problems by following examples and re-reading notes. I might be able to get the right answer, but I have to start all over again with the next question--and I can rarely predict the answer before I work out the calculations. With an intuitive understanding of a concept, I have a mental model of how it works. I can guess how calculations might turn out, and use them to confirm my understanding. Now that I'm in grad school and work in a lab, I don't have homework and don't even do calculations very often--but a model helps me predict what should happen when I turn a knob or rotate a polarizer. 

The moment of intuitive understanding is mysterious. I don't know a reliable way of getting there, and often I move on before I ever do (the second half of a college thermodynamics class comes to mind). Other, smarter people can probably reach intuition about things that will always be a list of facts to me. But sometimes it happens, and I want to share an example of an explanation that helped me finally understand one of the most important concepts in quantum physics: entanglement.
