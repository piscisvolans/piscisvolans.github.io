Quick reference guide for science writing Target: Busy grad students who don't really care about grammar and style but don't want to look dumb or get a bunch of red marks from their advisors.

Hyphens. My advisor loves hyphens. No matter how careful you are about hyphens, he will find one you missed.

Hyphens are necessary in most compound adjectives, with a few exceptions. UNITS Yes: "30-nm bandwidth" No: "The wavelength is 30 nm."

COMPOUND ADJECTIVES (adjectives made of more than one word) unless the first one ends in -ly: Yes: "Single-photon detector" No: "Horizontally polarized light", "Completely mixed quantum state"
